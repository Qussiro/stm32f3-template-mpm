/*
Linker script for STM32F303xC definitions with 256K Flash and 40K RAM

Memory sizes for STM32F3xx (x is one of C/R/V, indicating pin count 48/64/100):
                Flash  RAM  CCRAM
STM32F302xB		128	   24   0
STM32F302xC		256	   32   0
STM32F303xB		128	   32   8
STM32F303xC		256	   40   8

The CCRAM or "core coupled RAM" is on both data and instruction bus
so code can execute from there.
Parity checking exists on CCRAM and on first 16K of main RAM.
